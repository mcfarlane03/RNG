# Internet of Things (IoT) Template - Random Number Generator and Analysis

### Description
The hardware must generate a random integer upon pressing a button, display it on a seven-segment unit, and then publish it to a topic subscribed to, by both the backend and frontend sections of the system. It is also required to process and execute actions for any messages published to a topic to which it is subscribed.

The backend is tasked with storing data, published by the hardware, in the database following the schema specified in the hardware specifications. Additionally, it is responsible for making the stored data in the database accessible to the frontend through API routes.

The role of the frontend is to showcase the latest randomly generated integer published by the hardware on a webpage. Additionally, it must offer an interface, in the form of buttons, to toggle the state of two LEDs controlled by the hardware. Furthermore, the webpage should incorporate a chart or graph to illustrate the frequency distribution of each randomly generated integer stored in the database. Finally, it should include an interface, presented as cards, to retrieve and display a count of the amount of times each LED was turned on.


# Hardware Setup
Download and install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) IDE. Subsequently, install the following Arduino IDE libraries following the tutorial [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/5145457742236-Add-libraries-to-Arduino-IDE):
1. Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
2. Adafruit ILI9341 by Adafruit
3. ArduinoJson by Benoît Blanchon
4. PubSubClient by Nick O’Leary



# Backend Setup
Always ensure to establish a virtual environment and install the necessary packages from your requirements file if you haven't already done so. Following that, activate your virtual environment and proceed to run your Flask API.

### Create a virtual environment - env

Windows 
```sh
python -m venv env  
```
Linux
```sh
python3 -m venv env  
```
### Activate env
Windows
```sh
.\env\Scripts\activate 
```
Linux
```sh
source env/bin/activate
```
### Install API requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Start Flask API
Windows
```sh
py run.py 
```
Linux
```sh
python3 run.py
```



# Frontend Setup ( [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/all/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
### Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

Customize configuration
See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

Project Setup
```sh
npm install
```

Run dev server (Compile and Hot-Reload for Development)
```sh
npm run dev
```

Create a production bundle (Compile and Minify for Production)
```sh
npm run build
```
